## Getting started

Here are the general instructions to build Linphone for desktop. The specific instructions for each build platform is described just below.
You will need the tools :
- `cmake` >= 3.22 : download it in https://cmake.org/download/
- `python` : https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-381/
- `pip` : it is already embedded inside Python, so there should be nothing to do about it
- `yasm` : https://yasm.tortall.net/Download.html
- `nasm` : https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/
- `doxygen` (required for the Cxx Wrapper)
- `Perl`
- `pystache` : use 'pip install pystache --user'
- `six` : use 'pip install six --user'
- `git`

For Desktop : you will need [Qt6](https://www.qt.io/download-thank-you) (_6.2 or newer_). `C++17` support is required!

### Set your environment

1. It's necessary to install the `pip` command and to execute:

        pip install pystache six

2. You have to set the environment variable `Qt6_DIR` to point to the path containing the cmake folders of Qt6, and the `PATH` to the Qt6 `bin`. Example:

        Qt6_DIR="~/Qt/6.5.3/gcc_64/lib/cmake/Qt6"
        PATH="~/Qt/6.5.3/gcc_64/bin/:$PATH"

Note: If you have the third party tool `qtchooser` installed : 
        eval "$(qtchooser -print-env)"
        export Qt6_DIR=${QTLIBDIR}/cmake/Qt6
        export PATH=${QTTOOLDIR}:$PATH
3. For specific requirements, see platform instructions sections below.

### Summary of Building steps

        `git clone https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/linphone-desktop.git --recursive`
        `cd linphone-desktop`
        `mkdir build`
        `cd build`
        `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=10 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`
        `cmake --build . --parallel 10 --config RelWithDebInfo`
        `cmake --install .`
        `./OUTPUT/bin/linphone --verbose` or `./OUTPUT/Linphone.app/Contents/MacOS/linphone --verbose`

### Get sources

        git clone https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/linphone-desktop.git --recursive


### Building : General Steps

The build is done by building the SDK and the application. Their targets are `sdk` and `Linphone`.

1. Create your build folder at the root of the project : `mkdir build`
Go to this new folder and begin the build process : `cd build`

2. Prepare your options : `cmake ..`. By default, it will try compile all needed dependencies. You can remove some by adding `-DENABLE_<COMPONENT>=NO` to the command. You can use `cmake-gui ..` if you want to have a better access to them. You can add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=<count>` to do `<count>` parallel builds for speeding up the process.
Also, you can add `-DENABLE_BUILD_VERBOSE=ON` to get more feedback while generating the project.

Note : For Makefile or Ninja, you have to add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<your_config>` if you wish to build in a specific configuration (for example `RelWithDebInfo`).

3. Build and install the whole project : `cmake --build . --target <target> --parallel <count>` (replace `<target>` with the target name and `<count>` by the number of parallel builds).

Note : For XCode or Visual Studio, you have to add `--config <your_config>` if you wish to build in a specific configuration (for example `RelWithDebInfo`).

When all are over, the files will be in the OUTPUT folder in the build directory. When rebuilding, you have to use `cmake --build . --target install` (or `cmake --install .`) to put the application in the correct configuration.

Binaries inside other folders (like `build/bin/` and `linphone-sdk`) are not supposed to work.

4. When doing some modifications in the SDK, you can rebuild only the SDK with the target `sdk` and the same for the application with `linphone-qt-only`

5. In order to get packages, you can use `cmake .. -DENABLE_APP_PACKAGING=YES`. The files will be in `OUTPUT/packages` folder.


### Update your project

1. Update your project with :

    git fetch
    git pull --rebase

2. Update sub-modules from your current branch

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Then simply re-build using cmake.


#### General Troubleshooting

* The latest version of Doxygen may not work with the SDK. If you some build issues and have a specific version of Doxygen that is not in your PATH, you can use `-DLINPHONESDK_DOXYGEN_PROGRAM`.

Eg on Mac : `-DLINPHONESDK_DOXYGEN_PROGRAM=/Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/Resources/doxygen`

* If the build of the SDK crash with something like "cmd.exe failed" and no more info, it can be a dependency that is not available. You have to check if all are in your PATH.
Usually, if it is about VPX or Decaf, this could come from your Perl installation.

* If the application doesn't start and create an empty file with a random name, it could be come from a bad configuration between your application and others sub-modules. Check your configurations and force them with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<your_config>` or `--config <your_config>`.

* On Mac, the application can crash at the start from QOpenGLContext. A workaround is to deactivate the mipmap mode on images by adding into your configuration file (linphonerc): `mipmap_enabled=0` in `[ui]` section.


## Specific instructions for the Mac Os X platform

To install the required dependencies on Mac OS X, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
Before you install packages with Brew, you may have to change directories permissions (if you can't change permissions with sudo on a MacOS >= High Sierra, get a look at [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16432071/how-to-fix-homebrew-permissions#46844441)).

1. Install XCode from the Apple store. Run it at least once to allow it to install its tools. You may need to run :

	xcode-select --install

2. Install Homebrew by following the instructions here https://brew.sh/

3. Install dependencies:

    brew install cmake pkg-config git doxygen nasm yasm

4. First ensure you have [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

5. Then, you can install a pip package with the following command:

    python -m pip install [package]

 For instance, enter the following command:

    python -m pip install pystache six graphviz

6. Download [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download), install a Qt6 version and set Qt6_DIR and PATH variables.

7. If you are building on a arm64 system and want a Intel version, you have to select the x86_64 processor on the generation stage of cmake :

	-DCMAKE_APPLE_SILICON_PROCESSOR=x86_64

8. Build as usual (General Steps).

9. If you get an error about modules that are not found for Python, it may be because cmake try to use another version from your PATH. It can be the case if you installed Python from brew. Install Python modules by using absolute path.
For example:

	/opt/homebrew/python3 -m pip install pystache six graphviz

## Specific instructions for the Windows platform

32-bit version is not supported as Qt6 doesn't provide 32bits packages for MSVC.
Visual Studio 2022 is only supported.

1. Install main tools:
  - `MinGW/MSYS2` : [download](https://www.msys2.org/)
    - Follow instructions on their "Getting Started" page.
    - Install toolchains and prepare python:
      - `pacman -Sy --needed base-devel mingw-w64-mingw64-toolchain`
      - `pacman -S python3-pip` in `MSYS2 MSYS` console
      - `python3 -m pip install pystache six` in `cmd`
      - In this order, add `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin`, `C:\msys64\` and `C:\msys64\usr\bin` in your PATH environement variable from Windows advanced settings. Binaries from the msys folder (not from mingw64) doesn't fully support Windows Path and thus, they are to be avoided.

Specify `-DENABLE_WINDOWS_TOOLS_CHECK=ON` when building the SDK to install automatically missing tools from MSYS2 : `toolchain`, `python`, `doxygen`, `perl`, `yasm`, `gawk`, `bzip2`, `nasm`, `sed`, `patch`, `pkg-config`, `gettext`, `glib2`, `intltool` and `graphviz` (if needed)

  - `git` : use MSYS2 : `pacman -S git` or [download](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

  - Visual Studio must also be properly configured with addons. Under "Tools"->"Obtain tools and features", make sure that the following components are installed:
    - Select Windows Universal Platform development and Desktop C++ Development

2. Ensure that you have downloaded the correct Qt version on msvc.

3. Or open a Command line with Visual Studio `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022` and call qtenv2.bat that is in your qt binaries eg: `C:\Qt\<version>\msvc2019\bin\qtenv2.bat`

4. Build as usual with adding `-A x64` to `cmake ..` (General Steps) :
  - `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=10 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -A x64`
The default build is very long. It is prefered to use the Ninja generator `-G "Ninja"`
  - `cmake --build . --target ALL_BUILD --parallel 10 --config RelWithDebInfo`

5. The project folder will be in the build directory and binaries should be in the OUTPUT folder.

## Specific instructions for Linux

sudo apt install qt6-base-dev

In case of 'module "QtQuick.\*" is not installed' error, you may install these packages:
  - qml-qt6
  - qml6-module-qtquick
  - qml6-module-qtquick-layouts
  - qml6-module-qtqml-workerscript
  - qml6-module-qtquick-controls
  - qml6-module-qtquick-templates

### Feedback or bug reporting

Launch the application with `--verbose` parameter to get full logs and send it with your request. You can use the "Send logs" button in settings to upload log files and share it by email or with a post in the corresponding Github project :
- [Desktop Application](https://github.com/BelledonneCommunications/linphone-desktop/issues)
- [Linphone SDK](https://github.com/BelledonneCommunications/linphone-sdk/issues)

On some OS (like Fedora 22 and later), they disable Qt debug output by default. To get full output, you need to create `~/.config/QtProject/qtlogging.ini` and add :

        [Rules]
        *.debug=true
        qt.*.debug=false
