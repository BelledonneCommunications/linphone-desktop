## Getting started

Here are the general instructions to build Linphone for desktop. The specific instructions for each build platform is described just below.
You will need the tools :
- `cmake` >= 3.15 : download it in https://cmake.org/download/
- `python` : https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-381/
- `pip` : it is already embedded inside Python, so there should be nothing to do about it
- `yasm` : https://yasm.tortall.net/Download.html
- `nasm` : https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/
- `doxygen` (required for the Cxx Wrapper)
- `Perl` : (can be downloaded at http://strawberryperl.com/ for Windows. Set your Path to Perl binaries)
- `Pystache` : use 'pip install pystache --user'
- `six` : use 'pip install six --user'
- `git`

For Desktop : you will need [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/download-thank-you) (_5.12 or newer_). `C++11` support is required!

### Set your environment

1. It's necessary to install the `pip` command and to execute:

        pip install pystache

2. You have to set the environment variable `Qt5_DIR` to point to the path containing the cmake folders of Qt5, and the `PATH` to the Qt5 `bin`. Example:

        Qt5_DIR="~/Qt/5.12.5/gcc_64/lib/cmake"
        PATH="~/Qt/5.12.5/gcc_64/bin/:$PATH"

Note: If you have `qtchooser` set in your `PATH`, the best use is :

        eval "$(qtchooser -print-env)"
        export Qt5_DIR=${QTLIBDIR}/cmake/Qt5
        export PATH=${QTTOOLDIR}:$PATH
3. For specific requirements, see platform instructions sections below.

### Summary of Building steps

        `git clone https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/linphone-desktop.git --recursive`
        `cd linphone-desktop`
        `mkdir build`
        `cd build`
        `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=10 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`
        `cmake --build . --target install --parallel 10 --config RelWithDebInfo`
        `./OUTPUT/bin/linphone --verbose` or `./OUTPUT/Linphone.app/Contents/MacOS/linphone --verbose`

### Get sources

1. Clone repository:

        git clone https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/linphone-desktop.git --recursive        

2. Update sub-modules

        git submodule update --init --recursive

		
### Building : General Steps

The build is done by building the SDK and the application. Their targets are `sdk` and `linphone-qt`.		

1. Create your build folder at the root of the project : `mkdir build`
Go to this new folder and begin the build process : `cd build`

2. Prepare your options : `cmake ..`. By default, it will try compile all needed dependencies. You can remove some by adding `-DENABLE_<COMPONENT>=NO` to the command. You can use `cmake-gui ..` if you want to have a better access to them. You can add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=<count>` to do `<count>` parallel builds for speeding up the process.
Also, you can add `-DENABLE_BUILD_VERBOSE=ON` to get more feedback while generating the project.

Note : For Makefile or Ninja, you have to add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<your_config>` if you wish to build in a specific configuration (for example `RelWithDebInfo`).

3. Build and install the whole project : `cmake --build . --target <target> --parallel <count>` (replace `<target>` with the target name and `<count>` by the number of parallel builds).

Note : For XCode or Visual Studio, you have to add `--config <your_config>` if you wish to build in a specific configuration (for example `RelWithDebInfo`).

When all are over, the files will be in the OUTPUT folder in the build directory. When rebuilding, you have to use `cmake --build . --target install` (or `cmake --install .`) to put the application in the correct configuration.

4. When doing some modifications in the SDK, you can rebuild only the SDK with the target `sdk` and the same for the application with `linphone-qt-only`

5. In order to get packages, you can use `cmake .. -DENABLE_APP_PACKAGING=YES`. The files will be in `OUTPUT/packages` folder.


### Update your project

1. Update your project with :

        git fetch
        git pull --rebase
        
2. Update sub-modules from your current branch

        git submodule update --init --recursive

Then simply re-build using cmake.


#### General Troubleshooting

* The latest version of Doxygen may not work with the SDK. If you some build issues and have a specific version of Doxygen that is not in your PATH, you can use `-DLINPHONESDK_DOXYGEN_PROGRAM`.

Eg on Mac : `-DLINPHONESDK_DOXYGEN_PROGRAM=/Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/Resources/doxygen`

* If the build of the SDK crash with something like "cmd.exe failed" and no more info, it can be a dependency that is not available. You have to check if all are in your PATH.
Usually, if it is about VPX or Decaf, this could come from your Perl installation.

* If the application doesn't start and create an empty file with a random name, it could be come from a bad configuration between your application and others sub-modules. Check your configurations and force them with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<your_config>` or `--config <your_config>`.


## Specific instructions for the Mac Os X platform

To install the required dependencies on Mac OS X, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
Before you install packages with Brew, you may have to change directories permissions (if you can't change permissions with sudo on a MacOS >= High Sierra, get a look at [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16432071/how-to-fix-homebrew-permissions#46844441)).

1. Install XCode from the Apple store. Run it at least once to allow it to install its tools.

2. Install Homebrew by following the instructions here https://brew.sh/

3. Install dependencies:

        brew install cmake qt git

4. First ensure you have installed pip. You can get it for python 2.7 [there](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34886101/how-to-install-pip-to-python-2-7-10-on-mac#34886254).

5. Then, you can install a pip package with the following command:

        pip install [package]

 For instance, if you don't have pystache and the dot package (contained in graphviz), enter the following commands:

        pip install pystache
        pip install graphviz

6. Build as usual (General Steps) :
  - `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=10 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`
  - `cmake --build . --target all --parallel 10 --config RelWithDebInfo`

7. The project folder will be in the build directory and binaries should be in the OUTPUT folder.

8. When updating the project, the next build steps are a bit different:
    - `cmake --build . --target all --parallel 10 --config RelWithDebInfo`
    - `cmake --install .`
OR
    - `cmake --build . --target install --parallel 10 --config RelWithDebInfo`

## Specific instructions for the Windows platform

1. Ensure that you have downloaded the `Qt msvc2015 version` or `Qt msvc2017 version` (32-bit). (64-bit version is not supported at this moment by Linphone Desktop.)
  - `MinGW` : [download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)
    - Select all installer options except Ada and Fortran
    - Install it in the default location (C:/Mingw), this is important as there are hard-links on it.
    - The gcc version should be 6.3.0. It wasn't tested for other versions. It seems that MinGW from osdn.net try to install gcc 9 that breaks the build.
  - `Yasm`
    - download yasm-1.3.0-win32.exe
    - copy it to a bin directory of your user directory
    - rename yasm-1.3.0-win32.exe as yasm.exe
  - `nasm` : [download](https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.14.02/win64/)
  - `git` : [download](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Visual Studio must also be properly configured with addons. Under "Tools"->"Obtain tools and features", make sure that the following components are installed:
  - Tasks: Select Windows Universal Platform development, Desktop C++ Development, .NET Development
  - Under "Installation details". Go to "Desktop C++ Development" and add "SDK Windows 8.1 and SDK UCRT"
  - Individual component: Windows 8.1 SDK

2. Or open a Command line with Visual Studio `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017` and call qtenv2.bat that is in your qt binaries eg: `C:\Qt\<version>\msvc2017\bin\qtenv2.bat`

3. Install msys-coreutils : `mingw-get install msys-coreutils`

4. Build as usual with adding `-A Win32` to `cmake ..` (General Steps) :
  - `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=10 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -A Win32`
  - `cmake --build . --target ALL_BUILD --parallel 10 --config RelWithDebInfo`

5. The project folder will be in the build directory and binaries should be in the OUTPUT folder.

6. When updating the project, the next build steps are a bit different:
    - `cmake --build . --target ALL_BUILD --parallel 10 --config RelWithDebInfo`
    - `cmake --install .`
OR
    - `cmake --build . --target install --parallel 10 --config RelWithDebInfo`

## Specific instructions for the Mac Os X platform

1. Build as usual (General Steps) :
  - `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=10 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`
  - `cmake --build . --target all --parallel 10 --config RelWithDebInfo`

2. The project folder will be in the build directory and binaries should be in the OUTPUT folder.

3. When updating the project, the next build steps are a bit different:
    - `cmake --build . --target all --parallel 10 --config RelWithDebInfo`
    - `cmake --install .`
OR
    - `cmake --build . --target install --parallel 10 --config RelWithDebInfo`
