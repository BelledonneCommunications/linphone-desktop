Here are the general instructions to build linphone for desktop. The specific instructions for each build platform is described just below.
You will need the tools defined for Linphone-SDK 4.3 :
- cmake >= 3.6
- python = 2.7 (python 3.7 if C# wrapper generation is disabled)
- pip
- yasm
- nasm
- doxygen
- Pystache (use pip install pystache)
- six (use pip install six)
- Perl (can be downloaded at http://strawberryperl.com/ for Windows. Set your Path to perl binaries)

Set your environment:


1. Install some build tools: `CMake`, `Python` and `Qt5` (_5.9 or newer_). `C++11` support is required!
   It's necessary to install the `pip` command and to execute:

        pip install pystache

2. It's necessary to set the environment variable `Qt5_DIR` to point to the path containing the cmake folders of Qt5. Example:

        Qt5_DIR="~/Qt/5.9/gcc_64/lib/cmake"

3. The `PATH` environment variable must point to the Qt5 directory `bin`. Example:

        PATH="~/Qt/5.9/gcc_64/bin/:$PATH"		

		
Building:

The build is done in 3 steps. First, you need to build the SDK, then the submodule Minizip and finally, the application.

1. Create your build folder at the root of the project : `mkdir build-desktop`
Go to this new folder and begin the build process : `cd build-desktop`

2. Prepare your options : `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` By default, it will try compile all dependencies. You can remove some by adding `-ENABLE_<COMPONENT>=NO` to the command. You can use `cmake-gui ..` if you want to have a better access to them.

3. Build the SDK : `cmake --build . --target sdk`. You can add `--parallel 10` if you have CMake>3.12 to speedup the process.

4. Build The submodule. `cmake ..` and `cmake --build . --target install`

5. Finish the process with a new `cmake ..` and `cmake --build . --target install`.

When all are over, the files will be in the OUTPUT folder in the build directory.

You can find a script file for each supported platform to achieve the first building. Don't use it for a second one, they only exist for convenience.
There are called build_all_linux.sh, build_all_macos.sh and build_all_win.bat.

#### General Troubleshooting

* The latest version of Doxygen doesn't work with the SDK. If you have a specific version of Doxygen that is not in your PATH, you can use `-DLINPHONESDK_DOXYGEN_PROGRAM`.

Eg on Mac : `-DLINPHONESDK_DOXYGEN_PROGRAM=/Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/Resources/doxygen=/Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/Resources/doxygen`

* If the build of the SDK crash with something like "cmd.exe failed" and no more info, it can be a dependency that is not available. You have to check if all are in your PATH.
Usually, if it is about VPX or Decaf, this could come from your Perl installation. 





#### Mac OS X Troubleshooting
To install the required dependencies on Mac OS X, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
Before you install packages with Brew, you may have to change directories permissions (if you can't change permissions with sudo on a MacOS >= High Sierra, get a look at [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16432071/how-to-fix-homebrew-permissions#46844441)).

1. First ensure you have installed pip. You can get it for python 2.7 [there](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34886101/how-to-install-pip-to-python-2-7-10-on-mac#34886254).

2. Then, you can install a pip package with the following command:

        pip install [package]

    For instance, if you don't have pystache and the dot package (contained in graphviz), enter the following commands:

        pip install pystache
        pip install graphviz


### Specific instructions for the Windows platform

1. Ensure that you have downloaded the `Qt msvc2015 version` or `Qt msvc2017 version` (32-bit). (64-bit version is not supported at this moment by Linphone Desktop.) `MinGW` must be installed too.

2. Define the `Qt5_DIR` and `PATH` environment variable to the Qt5 installation path:

        Qt5_DIR="C:\Qt\5.9\msvc2015\lib\cmake"
        PATH="C:\Qt\5.9\msvc2015\bin;%PATH%"

2. Or open a Command line with Visual Studio `Developer Comand Prompt for VS 2017` and call qtenv2.bat that is in your qt binaries eg: C:\Qt\5.12.6\msvc2017\bin\qtenv2.bat

3. Install msys-coreutils : `mingw-get install msys-coreutils`

4. Build as usual with adding `-A Win32` to each command (General Steps)

5. The project folder will be in the build directory.


## Known bugs and issues

* __4K (High DPI Displays)__ If you encounter troubles with high DPI displays on Windows, please to see this link: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-53022


## Updating your build

You need to update the project:

      git pull --rebase
      git submodule sync && git submodule update --init --recursive

Then simply re-building using the appropriate tool corresponding to your platform (make, Visual Studio...) should be sufficient to update the build (after having updated the source code via git).
However if the compilation fails, you may need to rebuild everything from scratch (Delete all files in your build-desktop folder).        

Then you re-build as usual.
