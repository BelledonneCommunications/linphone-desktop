H264 codec
----------
Mediastreamer 2 uses Cisco's OpenH264 library as H264 codec. OpenH264 is an
open source library but H264 is a coding format protected by a patent from
MPEG-LA. That's why that bundle does not embed any OpenH264 library and so you
will not able to use H264 out-the-box.

Fortunatly, Cisco Systems Inc. distribute OpenH264 in its binary form that you
can use in Mediastreamer without paying much royalties to MPEG-LA. However,
that binary file as a restrictive licence. See http://www.openh264.org/BINARY_LICENSE.txt form more information.


Installation procedure

The Cisco's provided OpenH264 library is available at this address:
